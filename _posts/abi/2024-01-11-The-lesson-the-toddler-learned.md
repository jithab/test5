<div class="abi">
A toddler next door entered my room, carrying a test tube containing some white liquid, which was for producing bubbles, and started jumping barefoot on my front door carpet, which had densely arranged spikes. She usually jumps like that on the carpet.

She spilled the liquid while jumping and the floor became dirty. She looked anxiously at me. I felt she would cry and decided to handle the situation smoothly so that she would feel relaxed and not guilty. I giggled as if I was enjoying a funny moment. I told her one minute and went into my kitchen to get some old clothes, and cleaned up the floor. She smiled and left. 

Our response to such a situation might create lifelong trauma in the kid. My hand trembles whenever I have to carry a cup of tea from the tea counter in a restaurant to my table. I don’t have such an issue in my room. The reason could be some experience in my childhood that might be triggering nervousness in me in public spaces.  

The toddler came again the next day, carrying a bottle of water. She poured the water on my floor and smiled at me expecting that I would giggle at the funny thing she had done. Apparently, the toddler learned her own lesson from the incident, which was not what I intended or imagined.

I couldn’t recall any psychology lessons I read to apply to the situation to change such behaviour, but I knew a traditional way of correcting such nasty behaviour. I looked into my kitchen and saw a coconut broomstick, which was short and thin, suitable for caning.
