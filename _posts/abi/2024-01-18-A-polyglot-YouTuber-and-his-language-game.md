In the last few days, I was watching several videos of a polyglot YouTuber, who is video-chatting with people from around the world. The interaction usually begins in English and in the middle, he will speak the participant's language and surprise them.

These interactions help us understand foreign people, languages and cultures. The vital ingredient for social media is emotions - these interactions can produce raw, authentic human emotions.

The participants express overwhelming surprise and happiness when they hear a foreign-looking person speak their language. Moreover, the YouTuber tries to invoke emotions from the participants by saying that he likes/loves their people/language/culture/country, that their language is the sweetest/most beautiful or that their people are so generous.

I don’t think a person can like/love several languages/cultures. One can be interested in many languages/cultures. The word interested is less intense than the word love or like.

I wonder what would be in his mind when he says he likes/loves their language/culture. I don’t think he speaks the truth about the state of his mind. He could be ignoring the intensity/variation of the meaning of the word and simply using an interesting or familiar word with a similar meaning as English is not the mother tongue of most of the participants. He could just want to make the other person happy. Or Is that all he wants simply generating emotions for the sake of video content? 

Or Is the premise - A person can’t like/love several languages/cultures - false?
