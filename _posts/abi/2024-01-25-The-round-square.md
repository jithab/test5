Let us analyse these two words - round and square. Both are geometrical shapes. These words can be used as both nouns and adjectives. Here, the word round is used as an adjective and the word square is a noun.  

If you use these words precisely, they are abstract ideas and mutually exclusive. Abstractly, this expression is meaningless.

Assume a square of size 20 cm and the radius of the corners 1 cm. What shape is it? Everyone would tell it is a square. Most humans would have a set of nouns to describe this shape - square, round or round-square. People prefer giving a shape name rather than describing the shape.

Increase the radius of the square 1 cm in each phase and ask what shape it is. People would say square in the initial phases,  round-square in the middle phases, and round in the last phases.

In the initial phase, the corner radius is 0 cm and the shape is a perfect square. In the last phase, the radius is 10 cm and the shape is a perfect round. You cannot say in which phase the shape becomes round-square or round because of the Sorites paradox.
