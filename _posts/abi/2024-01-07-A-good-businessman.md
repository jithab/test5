One of my room cleaning activities was to get rid of rarely used items. That day I found four books - two were business management entrance exam books and the other two were computer science books.

The computer science books were a few years old and might be outdated. The business books were bought just one year ago. I wished to gift the new books to someone who was preparing for business management entrance exams.

I decided to list the new books on a second-hand products listing website. Created a product page on the website, added some cover pictures of the books and wrote a simple description. I had to specify the product price. A high price would attract few buyers, whereas a low price would attract a flock of buyers, most of whom might not be preparing for any exams. I set 60% of the original price as the product price. 

I hadn’t had any clue how many days it would take to get it sold, but I got a message from a buyer within one hour. I shared my phone number and address. He said he would collect the items the next morning.

He came in an old motorcycle, wearing modest clothes. He seemed to be in his early twenties.

He wanted to prepare for an exam but couldn’t afford to buy those books. Even though I barely showed any interest in his story, he kept talking. He had relied on others’ books in his college days and school days, and he would keep his second-hand books intact so that they could be used by his brother, who was one year younger than he was.

His warmth and maturity impressed me. I told him I wanted to give the books for free to a needy student. I was glad I found the right person.

He communicated like a high-level business executive. I said to myself he would become a good businessman in the future. He thanked me and left.

After a few days, I visited the website to list the computer science books. The web page I opened was the page where the management books had been listed. I bumped into a book cover image under the similar-products section, which had a nice drawing around the book’s title. It was the same drawing I had drawn on one of the books I had sold!

I looked into the homepage of the seller and found the other book. Both books were listed with higher prices than the price I had given. There were a couple of other books he listed to be sold. 

Not in the future, but already he was a good businessman!
