<div class="abi">I was returning from a morning walk at the main park in the city, walking along a road. A pedestrian asked me for directions to the main city centre. I looked at both sides of the road and tried to get a sense of where I was. I felt that the road was perpendicular to the main city centre. My best guess was the direction I came, towards which he was walking.

I just gestured to him to continue walking and I too continued walking. After taking a few steps, I saw a perpendicular road and felt that was the right direction. However, I didn't have enough courage to say that that was the correct direction. Just a few seconds ago I was sure about the direction. I was no longer sure about that now. How could I trust my new intuition?

I called aloud and showed him the new direction and told him that I was not sure though.

Daily, we have to make lots of decisions quickly from limited information. For some problems, we will never get enough information to make the right decision. Go ahead and make the best decision out of the information on your hand.

For some other problems, we won’t get enough time to wait for further information. In such situations don’t procrastinate; take a decision quickly and revise it along the way when you get more information!
