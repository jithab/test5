I met a Chinese dude online. He was a computer programmer by profession and football player by passion. He wanted to be a football coach for school children.

Football in China was an intriguing topic for me. I had never heard that football was popular in China. We talked about our countries - India and China - and sports in our countries. Then I asked my typical question to any foreigner - Do you speak any other language?

“A little bit Japanese,” he replied.

Before I became familiar with language learners through social media, I used to think English was the only foreign language people learn around the world other than their native languages. 

People learn languages for various reasons - social,  cultural, economic, educational, etc. People from former Soviet Union countries may learn Russian for social - there are Russian speakers in those countries - and historical reasons. Muslims around the world learn Arabic to study their religion and culture. Those who study philosophy may learn languages like Latin, Greek, or German to study philosophy texts in the source language. People may learn Korean to watch Korean dramas and Japanese to watch Anime.

“Are you an anime fan?” I asked him.

“Not particularly. I learned to watch movies.”

I was not aware that Japanese films were popular. I might have watched some Japanese films, but I couldn’t remember any movie names or even plots in those movies. I thought It was an opportunity to point out our shared interest and create a bond with the stranger.

“I had watched a couple of Japanese movies a few years ago,” I said.

“No. No. I watch porn movies.”

“Why do you need language to watch porn movies?” 

“I want to know what they are talking about.”

“He He. I didn’t know we needed to know the language to watch porn,” I laughed.
