<div class="abi">	
I was sipping tea, having sweet, salty biscuits, and listening to a podcast. My neighbourhood toddler came near my table and looked at the biscuit packet on my table. 

“Biscuit?” she asked. I nodded.

I asked whether she wanted it. She nodded and smiled. I opened the packet wider and moved it towards her. She took one biscuit and went out. After a few minutes, she came again. I gestured to her to serve herself the biscuits. She took one more biscuit and went out again. She came again a couple of times and served biscuits herself. 

Her sister saw her eating a biscuit. She disapproved of it, and they both had conversation outside my room. 

“No, Thank you,” the toddler came near me and said with a huge smile. I just smiled back. She became happy and went out near her sister.

“No, Thank you,”  she quickly came back and said.

“Okay. Okay,” I smiled and nodded.

She laughed and went out, saying something to her sister in their mother tongue.

A few minutes later, after finishing the biscuit in her hand, she returned, took a biscuit and went out. I realised that the toddler didn’t understand the usage of the phrase no-thank-you. She was speaking her mother tongue pretty well. She started speaking English six months ago after joining pre-school.

The toddler was so keen on learning English. She was picking up words and phrases from two or three examples. Why did she fail to understand the phrase no-thank-you, which was explicitly taught by her sister? 

Her sister didn’t know how she got the biscuits. She might have guessed I had offered a biscuit to her. Thus, she taught the toddler a phrase that could be used to refuse an offer politely. However, the phrase couldn’t be used in the current context where I didn’t offer her biscuits, but had given permission to serve herself the biscuits if she wanted.
