<div class="abi">He asked his daughter to sum up who he was to her. 
“Taxidriver,” she replied.

He had been doing his fatherly duties and he was sure his daughter knew it. Then why did his daughter regard him as his job - a taxi driver? He preferred not to be identified with his profession to his daughter. He wanted to be described with a term that reflects his love and care towards his daughter.

He was transporting his daughter from one place to another, which would describe him as a taxi driver. That is just physical or material aspects of their relationship.  What about the mental or emotional aspects of their relationship? That is what matters to him. How can the term taxi driver be fit to it?  He transported his daughter from her childhood to her adulthood, which would describe him as a taxi driver. 

We have no idea what she meant by taxi driver. We don’t even know whether she was serious or just uttered whatever came to her mind at that time.
