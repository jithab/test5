<div class="abi">	
I usually have an in depth look into the task/problem at hand, which sometimes takes too much time and becomes a hurdle to produce actionable items. I want to analyse this problem and provide solutions to handle such situations.

First, list out  the stakeholders in the situation. Write down their interests and expectations from talking to them and making educated guesses. Stick to their interests and don’t disappoint their expectations.

Set a time limit for assessing the task and proposing an initial solution. In some situations, the cost of the time to come up with the solution is inversely proportional to the benefits of the solution. You need to figure out the sweet spot where cost of the time and benefits are optimal.

You don’t need to inspect the problem meticulously; Overlook insignificant details and ignore irrelevant details. Look into the crucial aspects of the problem, assign weights to the aspects and generate a solution that maximises the objective.

Frame the problem in a simple, lucid language and deliver the solution in a decisive language.
