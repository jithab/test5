<div class="abi">	
I saw a two-column cartoon, where the first column had the text: When you finally get your crush's heart. And the second column text: But you don't know where to put the body.

I want to analyse why this cartoon works. The main word in the cartoon is heart, which can be used to mean either a concrete object or an abstract idea. The object is one of the human organs. The idea is the imaginary organ where our feelings reside.

What decides which meaning should be chosen? Usually, it is the context which determines the meaning of a word. In some contexts, multiple meanings could be possible. In this context, the second meaning - the imaginary organ - seems the correct meaning for the word since the adjective "crush" is used with the word.

We read the second column text, and realise there is a dead body. Now, we try to make sense of the story based on the information we collected so far. The second text would make sense only if the meaning of the heart is the first meaning - the human organ. We change our understanding, which stimulates and delights us. The literary technique used in this joke is called pull back and reveal.
