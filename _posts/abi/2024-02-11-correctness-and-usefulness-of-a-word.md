I’m gonna show you a tree, said the vlogger.

“It’s a mango tree,” she said, pointing to a hog plum tree!

Why did she call the hog plum tree a mango tree? It could be a mistake, or the mango and the hog plum might be referred to by the same word in her language.

I didn’t know the word hog plum. If I had to name it, I would say fruit. I would be correct, and she is wrong. One of the problems with some language learners is their obsession with correctness. They are happy to be quiet rather than making occasional mistakes. If you want to improve your language, you should keep talking even about the topics you are not familiar with! 

She said mango, and I would say fruit. Who is right? This question is wrong. Why should you care who is right? Communication should be measured by its usefulness, not by correctness. You don’t need to be precise - just try to be as accurate as possible.

You can call it mango rather than fruit because it will give a good idea about the nature of the fruit - these two fruits can be pickled or eaten with salt.  It is better to call it “a fruit like mango” to avoid confusing those who know hog plums.

It reminded me of a word I read in a 1984 New York Times article - banalization:  the replacement of an intended word by an erroneous one that is more familiar or simpler.
