<div class="abi">	
Passing through an unusual crowd in front of the metro station, I reached the entry gate, where two policemen were standing apart from the station security guard. One of the policemen asked me where I wanted to go. He said the trains on the route had been temporarily halted.

I walked back home through a different route. On the way, I saw a phrase written on the board outside the wall of a shop - Building for Rent. I thought it was funny. Why did they want to inform the public they were building the shop for rent? I couldn't see any construction going on. The shop seemed recently vacated and repainted, which bewildered me.  

I realised the word building was used to refer to the shop structure. I assumed the word was used to refer to the construction. In other words, my mind expanded the phrase as "We are <b>building</b> it <b>for rent</b>" instead of "This <b>building</b> is <b>for rent</b>."
