The antagonist was beaten up like anything. In the final scene, he opened his eyes, signalling a possible sequel of the movie.

Removing my 3D glasses, I walked towards the exit door, where a theatre staff was standing, holding a basket. I tried to put the glasses in their case, but I couldn't. I deposited both the glasses and their cover into the basket.

I had to travel around 90 minutes to the theatre. The movie was three hours long. I was tired and I had to travel back again. I decided to use the washroom and walked towards the entry door. 

Only when I reached near the entry door, I noticed the door was closed. I was not sure that either the door could be opened or I would be allowed inside the theatre central hall. My initial instinct was to use the open door and leave the theatre. I turned towards the exit door and started walking.

A question came to my mind: If I wanted something and found a hurdle, should I give up what I wanted rather than facing the obstacle? I should overcome my challenge and fulfil my interest. I turned again and decided to challenge my intuition!

 We should wish for and embrace the closed doors, not the open doors. The former would challenge and enrich you. The latter wouldnâ€™t have any impact on your personality.
