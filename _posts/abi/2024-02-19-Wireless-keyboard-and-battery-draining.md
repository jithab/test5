When I bought my latest laptop, my work desk went through a drastic makeover. I purchased a corner table, a rolling chair, a laptop stand, and a wireless keyboard and mouse.

Both the keyboard and the mouse needed batteries. There was a small wireless receiver which needed to be connected to the laptop. The product description claimed that the batteries would last several months. However, the keyboard battery lasted only a week or so.

The batteries they shipped along with the product might be old. I tried a new battery, but it lasted only ten days. The next new battery confirmed that the battery wouldn't last more than two weeks.

I searched on the internet whether the issue was already known, and whether there were any solutions available. I couldn't see that anyone reported such an issue. I concluded my keyboard was faulty. I was not sure I could return the product since it was a battery-draining issue. Nor did I know any place to get it repaired.

One puzzling aspect of the keyboard was that it had no power-off switch. I couldn't understand the design decision of omitting the switch. It turned out that the keyboard uses power only when the keys are pressed. Otherwise, It uses almost no power.

I was a computer programmer. I wouldn't type all the time when I work. We spent more time thinking than typing. Suddenly, I remembered the place where the keyboard was being kept after my work - inside my laptop bag.

I brought the bag to my work desk, kept the keyboard inside the bag, and looked at the notepad on the laptop. The enter key was kept getting pressed!
