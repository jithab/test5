The title of this article was the title of a 2019 Guardian article about John Chau. When we read about a person who tries to save a bunch of savages even on the brink of his own death, we will be impressed by the person. Chau was a 26-year-old American Christian missionary. He died on Sentinel Island, which is under Indian control and access to the island is strictly forbidden. Chau believed the island was Satan's last stronghold and wanted to spread the message of Jesus.

I want to analyse the phrase "to convert his killers." Is it true he tried to convert his killers? Let us analyse the word killing first. Chau was believed to be killed by Sentinelese. Was it killing? Yes and No. Yes, because they acted deliberately to cause his death. No, because the word killing vilifies the killers. Sentinelese didn't kill him because of any personal reasons. The island is the land of Sentinelese. India and other nations may be considering it as part of India. However, for Sentinelese, the island is a sovereign nation, and their national security strategy is to kill anyone who intrudes on their land.

Chan entered an unauthorised area, and the Sentinelese defence force shot and killed him. It was not an accident. Chau was well aware of the danger and went ahead with the suicidal mission. We should not say, "Sentinelese killed him," because making Sentinelese in the subject implies that they are bad actors and Chau was innocent. Chau should be the subject - Chau intruded on an unrestricted area and was shot and killed. 

Let us assume it was killing for the sake of analysing the phrase "to convert his killers." Did he try to convert his killers? He might have preached when Sentinels tried to kill him. However, That statement will mislead us that Chau decided to convert them only after they decided to kill him. That is not true. The decision for conversion had been taken several months before Chau entered the island, and they became killers only after he intruded on their land.

The title justifies and glorifies Chau, and vilifies Sentinelese. Chau should not be glorified. Nor should he be justified as he violated all Indian and Sentinelese rules and became a threat to Sentinelese. Sentinelese should not be vilified since they have the right to defend their land and take any action to protect their lives.
