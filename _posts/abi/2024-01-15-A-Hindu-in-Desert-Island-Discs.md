<div class="abi"><i>Desert Island Discs</i> is a long running BBC radio program, in which famous personalities are interviewed about their life and their eight favourite songs. At the end of the program, they will be cast away to a desert island with a Bible, complete works of Shakespeare and a book of their choice.

The Bible is significant for the English Language, which is the language of Britain and the program. However, all interviewees are not Christian. Nor are their first languages English. In one of the episodes, they gave a Quran instead of a Bible to the Muslim participant. 

Today, I was listening to a Desert Island Discs episode, in which the guest was Venki Ramakrishnan, a Nobel prize winning scientist.  From his name, I guessed he was of Indian origin and a Hindu. I was curious to know which holy book they would give to him - Bhagavad Gita, Mahabharata or Ramayana.

To my surprise, the host offered him a bible. However, Venki preferred Mahabharata. He said: “I would prefer the Mahabharata, which is the huge epic, of which one chapter alone is the Bhagavad Gita, which is one of Hinduism's more important works and it shows humans with all their foibles and their moral dilemmas and complexity and nothing is black and white.”

The book of his choice was “The Feynman Lectures on Physics”. Physics was my favourite subject in tenth grade, which gave me overnight fame in all three classes of my school tenth grade when I was able to score full marks in the quarterly physics exam. Till that point, I was relatively unknown even in my own class.

I had a chance to study physics for two years after tenth grade, but my interest had moved to Mathematics. Last couple of years, I have been thinking of reading some physics books to get a good understanding of the Universe. I had already heard about Feynman and his lectures, but I was not aware that it was available as a book. Hope I will read it soon.
