I couldn't recognize the flag in his online profile, which had a star on a blue background.

“Where are you from?” I asked.   

“Somalia. Do you know the country?” He replied.

I was familiar with the name Somalia. In my region and language, the word somalia is often used to mean the land of poverty. I didn’t want to offend him.

“I know your country name very well, even though I learnt nothing about Somlalians and their culture,” I said. “Is Somaliland another country or another name for your country? I started noticing  that name recently.” 

“It is in Somalia.”

I didn’t understand what he meant by that. He gave no further explanation.

“Is it a state or region in Somalia?” I asked.

“It is a state… a region…”

I wondered why he was not sure if it was a state or region. 

“How is Kashmir now?” He asked.

I didn't expect such a political question from him. How does this Somalian know a conflicted region in India? I was not interested in discussing political or religious issues with any stranger.

“It is stable now,” I answered. “This question was out of the blue.”

“You asked me about Somaliland.” He said.

“Oh… sorry, I didn’t know that Somaliland was a politically sensitive topic.”

“No issue. I am currently doing my graduation in politics.”

“I like reading politics,” I said. “Can you explain the Somaliland issue in two or three sentences?”

“Sure. Somaliland is a region of Somalia, which declared independence in 1991, and became autonomous.  Somalia still claims it as part of Somalia. No UN member nations recognized Somaliland’s sovereignty.”

“Excellent! crisp and clear!”
